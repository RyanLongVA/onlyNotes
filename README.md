This is a tool to semi-automate visual inspection of urls using the 
_"chromium browser with proxy set to 127.0.0.1"_

on a linux machine. I might expand on this so you can keep notes on the tabs you open.. but so far dare I say, I like this method better than 

How To Use:
    - Modify to fit your setup (because seriously it's catered toward my own... meaning it opens chromium... a specific profile... and I like to run my traffic through burp). If it is a complete disaster, feel free to ping me. 
    - Supply the bash script with a list of urls e.g. `sh startWebAppTesting.sh hiImAList.txt`
